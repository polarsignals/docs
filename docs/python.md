# Python Support

To enable profiling Python code enable the `--enable-python-unwinding` flag in the Polar Signals Agent.

:::note
Python profiling is currently in beta. There are some known CPU spikes in the agent that can occur when enabling Python profiling, once those are fixes Python support will no longer be in beta. The CPU spikes are not fatal, but we have a high bar for features we enable by default.
