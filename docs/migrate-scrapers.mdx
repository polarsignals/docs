# Migrate Scrapers to Service Accounts

This guide walks you through migrating your Polar Signals Scraper deployments from project tokens to the new IAM system using service accounts with minimal role bindings.

## What's Changing

Previously, scrapers authenticated using project-scoped JWT tokens. The new IAM system replaces these with:

- **Service accounts** — named identities with granular, role-based permissions
- **Service account tokens** — API tokens (format: `psc_v1_<64-hex-characters>`) tied to a service account
- **Role bindings** — assignments that grant only the permissions needed

The project to send data to is now specified separately via a `projectID` gRPC metadata header, rather than being embedded in the token.

## Steps

### 1. Create a Service Account

1. Go to your organization settings
2. Navigate to **IAM** > **Service Accounts**
3. Click **Create Service Account**
4. Enter a descriptive name (e.g., `production-scraper`)

<BrowserWindow>

</BrowserWindow>

### 2. Create a Role Binding

1. Go to **IAM** > **Role Bindings**
2. Click **Create Role Binding**
3. Select your new service account as the subject
4. Select the **Profile Writer** role
5. Optionally, scope the binding to a specific project

Scrapers only send profiling data (heap, mutex, goroutine, etc.) — they do not upload debug information. The **Profile Writer** role grants `profile.write`, which is all that's needed.

### 3. Generate a Token

1. Go to **IAM** > **Service Accounts** and click on your service account
2. In the **Tokens** section, click **Create Token**
3. **Copy the token immediately** — it is only shown once

<BrowserWindow>

</BrowserWindow>

### 4. Update Your Scraper Configuration

Replace the old project token with the new service account token and add the `projectID` header. The two key flags are:

- **Token**: `--bearer-token-file` (path to a file containing the token)
- **Project ID**: `--grpc-headers=projectID=<your-project-id>`

Find your project ID in your project settings in the Polar Signals Cloud UI.

### 5. Verify and Revoke

After restarting the scraper, verify that scraped profiling data is arriving in Polar Signals Cloud. Then revoke the old project token to complete the migration.
