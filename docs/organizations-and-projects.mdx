# Organizations and Projects

## Organizations
Organizations are the top-level umbrella for all the projects in a company. A user can create multiple organizations to separate projects under different companies or teams.
An organization can have multiple users who have access to all projects under the organization. Users can invite other users to join and manage the organization. Check out the [Invite Users](/docs/invite-users) page for more information on inviting users to an organization.

The name of the organization can typically be the name of the company or the department.

Example: **My Company**.

## Projects
Projects are the workspaces for profile data within an organization, mainly to collect profiles that belong to a specific application or environment. Profiles within a project can be compared and analysed against each other as required.
There can be multiple projects within an organization, and the users of an organization have access to all projects within the organization.

Example: **Production Environment**.
