	1. Use the scopes: `profile`, `email`, and `groups`. Learn more in the [Dex documentation](https://dexidp.io/docs/configuration/custom-scopes-claims-clients/).

## Security
The SSO login is designed with security in mind. Here are some insights into the security measures in place:
- **SSO Credentials**: The SSO credentials are stored encrypted in a [Vault](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault) instance, to which the application has write-only access. For that reason, you can only create new configs and cannot edit an existing one if you have any modifications to make.
- **HTTPS**: The SSO login is served over HTTPS to ensure all data is encrypted in transit.
