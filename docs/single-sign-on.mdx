## Security
The SSO login is designed with security in mind. Here are some insights into the security measures in place:
- **SSO Credentials**: The SSO credentials are stored encrypted in a vault instance, to which the application has a write-only access and that is reason you can only create new config and cannot edit exiting one if you have any modifications to make.
- **HTTPS**: The SSO login is served over HTTPS to ensure that all data is encrypted in transit.
