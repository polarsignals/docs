# Organization User Roles and Permissions

Polar Signals Cloud uses a role-based access control (RBAC) system to manage user and service account permissions. Roles define sets of permissions, and these roles are assigned to users or service accounts through role bindings.

## Understanding the IAM System

The IAM system consists of three main components:

- **Roles**: Collections of permissions that define what actions can be performed
- **Role Bindings**: Assignments that grant a specific role to a user or service account
- **Permissions**: Individual capabilities like `profile.read`, `profile.write`, `project.create`, etc.

## System Roles

Polar Signals Cloud provides several built-in system roles:

### Owner
The Owner role has full access to the organization and can perform all management actions. This includes:
- Viewing profiling reports
- Creating, updating, and deleting projects
- Managing service accounts and tokens
- Creating and managing role bindings
- Inviting users
- Configuring Single Sign-On (SSO)
- Managing billing
- Creating custom roles
- Deleting the organization

### Viewer
The Viewer role has read-only access to the organization. This includes:
- Viewing profiling reports
- Viewing projects
- Listing organization resources

### Writer
The Writer role can send profiling data to projects. This includes:
- All permissions from the Viewer role
- Writing profiling data (`profile.write`)
- Writing debug information (`debuginfo.write`)

This role is ideal for service accounts used by profiling agents.

### Profile Writer
The Profile Writer role is a specialized role for sending only profiling data:
- Writing profiling data (`profile.write`)

This role is ideal for service accounts that only need to send profiles, without any read access.

### Debug Info Writer
The Debug Info Writer role is a specialized role for uploading debug information:
- Writing debug information (`debuginfo.write`)

This role is ideal for service accounts or CI/CD pipelines that upload debug symbols.

## Managing User Roles

### Viewing Role Bindings

To view who has access to your organization:
1. Go to your organization settings
2. Navigate to the **IAM** tab
3. Select the **Role Bindings** section

<BrowserWindow>

![Role Bindings page](/img/iam-role-bindings.png)

</BrowserWindow>

Here you can see all users and service accounts along with their assigned roles.

### Granting Roles to Users

To grant a role to a user:
1. Go to the **Role Bindings** section in the IAM tab
2. Click **Create Role Binding**
3. Select the user as the subject
4. Select the role to assign
5. Optionally, scope the role binding to a specific project
6. Click **Create**

<BrowserWindow>

</BrowserWindow>

### Changing User Roles

To change a user's role:
1. In the **Role Bindings** section, find the role binding you want to modify
2. Delete the existing role binding
3. Create a new role binding with the desired role

:::info
You cannot remove the last Owner role binding from an organization. Make sure there is at least one Owner in the organization at all times.

### Removing User Access

To remove a user's access:
1. Go to the **Role Bindings** section
2. Find all role bindings for the user
3. Click **Delete** on each role binding

## Custom Roles

Organizations can create custom roles with specific sets of permissions tailored to their needs.

### Creating a Custom Role

1. Go to your organization settings
2. Navigate to the **IAM** tab
3. Select the **Roles** section
4. Click **Create Role**
5. Enter a name for the role
6. Select the permissions to include
7. Click **Create**

<BrowserWindow>

</BrowserWindow>

### Available Permissions

Permissions are organized by resource type:

**Profile Data:**
- `profile.read` - View profiling data
- `profile.write` - Send profiling data

**Projects:**
- `project.read` - View project details
- `project.list` - List projects
- `project.create` - Create new projects
- `project.update` - Modify projects
- `project.delete` - Delete projects

**Views:**
- `view.read` - View saved views
- `view.list` - List views
- `view.create` - Create views
- `view.update` - Modify views
- `view.delete` - Delete views

**Organization:**
- `organization.read` - View organization details
- `organization.update` - Modify organization settings
- `organization.delete` - Delete organization
- `organization.usage.read` - View usage data

**Service Accounts:**
- `serviceaccount.list` - List service accounts
- `serviceaccount.create` - Create service accounts
- `serviceaccount.delete` - Delete service accounts
- `serviceaccounttoken.list` - List tokens
- `serviceaccounttoken.create` - Create tokens
- `serviceaccounttoken.delete` - Delete tokens

**IAM Management:**
- `role.list` - List roles
- `role.create` - Create custom roles
- `role.delete` - Delete custom roles
- `rolebinding.list` - List role bindings
- `rolebinding.create` - Create role bindings
- `rolebinding.delete` - Delete role bindings
- `invite.list` - List invites
- `invite.create` - Create invites
- `invite.expire` - Expire invites

**Debug Info:**
- `debuginfo.list` - List debug information
- `debuginfo.read` - Read debug information
- `debuginfo.write` - Upload debug information

**Billing:**
- `billing.read` - View billing information
- `billing.modify` - Modify billing settings

## Project-Scoped Role Bindings

Role bindings can optionally be scoped to a specific project. When scoped, the permissions only apply within that project's context.

For example, you might grant a user the Viewer role scoped to a specific project, allowing them to view profiling data only for that project.

To create a project-scoped role binding:
1. When creating a role binding, check the **Scope to project** option
2. Select the project from the dropdown
3. Complete the role binding creation

## Service Account Roles

Service accounts (used for API authentication) can be granted roles just like users. This is essential for:
- Profiling agents that need to send data (use Writer or Profile Writer role)
- CI/CD pipelines that upload debug symbols (use Debug Info Writer role)
- Automation scripts that query data (use Viewer role)

See the [Generating Tokens documentation](generating-tokens.mdx) for details on creating service accounts and assigning them roles.
